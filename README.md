# F1-Tyre-Life-Prediction

This dissertation project is part of my MSc Business Analytics at Aston University. 
I used open-source data to build ensemble tree models to predict the tyre life in Formula 1. 
I used the data available from Ergast API, Fast F1 Library in Python and Pirelli's pre-race graphics. I used Scikit-Learn to create and compeare machine learning models and do hyperparameter tuning. 
I used Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for the predictions. Gradient Boosting performed better but had high overfitting. 

You can find the complete text dissertation and the full code in the two files in this repo.
